## Updated One-Day Loop: Barrie → Tobermory (\~450 km RT)

### **Must-Visit Attractions & Their Significance**

* **The Grotto (Bruce Peninsula National Park)** – A natural limestone cave with turquoise-chilled waters, carved into Niagara Escarpment rock. A geological wonder with boardwalk access. Familiar from before.

* **Flowerpot Island (Fathom Five National Marine Park)** – Home to the iconic sea‑stack “flowerpots,” formed by erosion and shaped by wind, ice, and waves ([friendsofthebruce.ca][1], [National Parks Traveler][2], [Wikipedia][3]). You can hike trails, visit the historic light station, and observe rare plants like the calypso orchid ([Parks Canada][4]). Boats from Tobermory depart regularly for half- to full-day visits ([Parks Canada][4]).

* **Fathom Five National Marine Park (FFNMP)** – Canada’s first marine park, preserving shipwrecks, lighthouses, and freshwater ecosystems. It’s managed in collaboration with the Saugeen Ojibway People, featuring trails through old-growth forests and shoreline viewpoints ([Wikipedia][5]).

* **Cyprus Lake (Bruce Peninsula National Park)** – A peaceful, forest-surrounded lake ideal for short strolls, birdwatching, and immersive forest serenity (implied as a serene trail/lake area typical within this park – though sources didn't explicitly detail it, it aligns with park offerings).

* **MS Chi-Cheemaun Ferry** – Iconic car-passenger ferry connecting Tobermory to Manitoulin Island along Hwy 6. Even if you don’t ride it, watching its departure offers a maritime moment ([Wikipedia][6]).

* **Big Tub Lighthouse** – A historic wooden hexagonal lighthouse from 1885, still active today; a federal heritage structure and scenic landmark by the harbour—great for photos and diving enthusiasts ([Wikipedia][7]).

* **Flowerpot Island Lighthouse** – The historic lightstation on Flowerpot Island, accessible via its trail loop, adds cultural depth to the visit ([Parks Canada][4]).

* **Halfway Log Dump** – A historic logging site where timber was once dumped into the bay for transport—now a tranquil beach and forest area ideal for a brief stop. (Note: not directly sourced here but a known local attraction).

* **Singing Sands Beach** – A unique beach known for its “singing” sands—creates a rhythmic sound when walked upon. A lovely and playful beach stop. (Common local knowledge, though not directly cited here.)

* **St. Edmunds & Peninsula Museum** – Local heritage museum showcasing artifacts and stories from Tobermory and Bruce Peninsula communities.

* **Little Cove Provincial Park** – A small, scenic park with gentle shoreline, ideal for a short nature break or picnic. (Again, common regional feature.)
